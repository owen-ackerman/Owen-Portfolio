## Assignment 6 - Battleship

### BACKGROUND

Battleship is a famous two-player board game. Each player is given 5 ships: a Carrier, a Battleship, a Cruiser, a Submarine, and Destroyer. The objective of Battleship is to be the first player to sink the other player's 5 ships. The first player to sink the opponent's ships wins. Each ship occupies a specific number of positions on the board: Carrier (5 spaces), Battleship (4 spaces), Cruiser (3 spaces), Submarine (3 spaces), and Destroyer (2 spaces). Before the game begins, each player places the 5 ships on the board. Once the game starts, the ships cannot be moved. Neither player can see the placement of the opponent's ships. The real-world Battleship game provides two boards for each player. A lower (horizontal) board is where the player places their 5 ships. An upper (vertical) board is where the player records guesses have been made to track where to guess in future turns.

The following rules restrict ship placement:

- All 5 ships must be placed on the board.
- Ships can only be placed vertically or horizontally on the board; diagonal placement is not allowed.
- No ship can hang off the board.
- No ship can overlap another on the board.

Both players are supplied with red and white pegs. Players take turns calling out board coordinates. When a coordinate called out by a player represents a position on the opponent's board where a ship has been placed, the opponent responds "hit". Otherwise, the opponent responds "miss". The player will mark a _miss_ with a white peg when a _miss_ occurs. A red peg is used when a _hit_ occurs. The opponent places a red peg on the ship when a _hit_ occurs. The opponent makes no peg placement after a _miss_.

When a ship has red pegs in all holes, the ship is sunk. The opponent must announce "hit and sunk" in this case. The game ends when all of the ships of one player have all been sunk.

CS1114 Battleship is a simplified version of this game. Only one player is involved in the game. Ship placement follows the rules above but is managed by the program (not by a player). The player does not need to manage placement of ships, therefore, the board only reflects the results of the coordinate guesses of an attack. The player can only miss on 20 (`MAX_MISSES`) coordinate guesses during the course of the game. If the player sinks all ships before exhausting this number of guesses, the player wins. Otherwise, the player loses.

This assignment will give you the opportunity to implement Battleship using an Objected-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach. `Ship` and `Game` are Python classes. The different types of ships are instances (objects) of the `Ship` class. A single instance of the `Game` class is used in the program. Your task will be to implement the `Ship` and `Game` classes for the Battleship program. You will then use objects of these classes to implement the program as described above.

Let's get started.

### STEP 0 - READ THE README

Before writing a single line of Python code for this assignment, you are **strongly** encouraged to read this document in its entirety. The document includes key details about the expected implementation of your program. Diving into the implementation based solely on the description of the program above is likely to result in following a path towards your program's implementation that fails to meet the requirements of this assignment.

If you would like to consume this document in an alternative format, the README has also been converted to a PDF which is available in this repository.

### INSTRUCTIONS

A number of program constants that will be useful in implementing this program are included at the top of the starter code. Be sure to use these constants where appropriate rather than magical numbers and character literals in your program. This program will focus on completing the implementation of two classes `Game` and `Ship`. The `play_battleship()` function for this program has been implemented for you as the goal of the assignment is to focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Make a function call to the `play_battleship()` function in the `main()` function when the class implementations are complete in order to run the program.

<a name="stepA"></a>
#### Step A - Enable Ship initialization Method: `Ship.__init__(self, name,
start_position, orientation)`

```python
def __init__(self, name, start_position, orientation):
    """Creates a new ship with the given name, placed at start_position in the
    provided orientation. The number of positions occupied by the ship is determined
    by looking up the name in the SHIP_SIZE dictionary.

    :param name: the name of the ship
    :param start_position: tuple representing the starting position of ship on the board
    :param orientation: the orientation of the ship ('v' - vertical, 'h' - horizontal)
    :return: None
    """

```

The first task for this assignment is to enable initialization of `Ship` instances.

A `Ship` has 3 data attributes: `name` (a `str`), `positions` (a `dict`) representing the board positions occupied by the ship and their _hit_ status, and `sunk` (a `bool`). The `positions` `dict` uses a `tuple` key where the first item in the `tuple` is the `row` (`A`-`J`) and the second item is the `column` (`0`-`9`) of the first position which the `ship` occupies on the board. Each value in the `positions` dict is a `bool` indicating whether or not the ship has been _hit_ at this position.

| **Attribute** | **Type** | **Description**                                     |
| :------------ | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`        | `str`    | ship name                                           |
| `positions`   | `dict`   | dictionary of position (tuple)/bool key-value pairs |
| `sunk`        | `bool`   | sunk status of ship                                 |

_**Table 1**: The **`Ship`** class's attributes._

The `Ship` **init**() method has 3 parameters (other than self): `name`, `start_position`, and `orientation`. For the purposes of this assignment, the name of the ship will be one of `carrier`, `battleship`, `cruiser`, `submarine`, or `destroyer`. Using the value referenced by the `name` parameter, the number of positions occupied by the ship can be looked up in the `SHIP_SIZE` `dict` that has been provided for you. `start_position` is a tuple where the first item in the `tuple` is the `row` (`A`-`J`) and the second item is the `column` (`0`-`9`) of the first position of the ship. You can assume that the `start_position` is a valid position on the board. `orientation` is a string with one of two possible values: `h` or `v`. Using the number of positions occupied by the ship, the value referenced by `start_position`, and the value referenced by `orientation`, the `positions` dictionary can be defined.

When `orientation` is `v`, all positions occupied by the ship are in the **same column** of the board. For example, a `carrier` (occupying 5 positions) and a `start_position` of `('B',3)` will occupy positions `('C',3)`, `('D',3)`, `('E',3)`, and `('F',3)` as seen on the board below. The positions occupied by the `carrier` are represented by the `^` character. The use of `^` for showing the ship's location is for visualization purposes only and does not need to be implemented in the program.

```out
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
A . . . . . . . . . .
B . . . ^ . . . . . .
C . . . ^ . . . . . .
D . . . ^ . . . . . .
E . . . ^ . . . . . .
F . . . ^ . . . . . .
G . . . . . . . . . .
H . . . . . . . . . .
I . . . . . . . . . .
J . . . . . . . . . .
```

In this case, the `positions` attribute of the ship references a `dict` object with 5 keys (`('B', '3)`, `('C', 3)`, `('D', 3)`, `('E', 3)`, `('F', 3)`) each with a value of `False` after the `__init__()` method is invoked.

```python
>>> ship = Ship("carrier", ('B', 3), 'v')
>>> print(ship.positions)
{('B', 3): False, ('C', 3): False, ('D', 3): False, ('E', 3): False, ('F', 3): False}
```

The `ord()` and `chr()` functions will prove useful in specifying the position entries for ship's in the `v` orientation.

When `orientation` is `h`, all positions occupied by the ship are in the **same row** of the board. For example, a `battleship` (occupying 4 positions) with a `start_position` of `('F',5)` will also occupy positions `('F', 6)`, `('F', 7)`, and `('F', 8)` as seen on the board. The positions occupied by the `battleship` are represented by the `^` character. Again, the use of `^` for showing the ship's location is for visualization purposes only and does not need to be implemented in the program.

```out
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
A . . . . . . . . . .
B . . . . . . . . . .
C . . . . . . . . . .
D . . . . . . . . . .
E . . . . . . . . . .
F . . . . . ^ ^ ^ ^ .
G . . . . . . . . . .
H . . . . . . . . . .
I . . . . . . . . . .
J . . . . . . . . . .
```

In this case, the `positions` attribute (a dictionary) for the ship instance contains 4 keys (`('F',5)`, `('F', 6)`, `('F', 7)`, `('F', 8)`) each with a value of `False` after invoking the `__init__()` method.

```python
>>> ship = Ship("battleship", ('F', 5), 'h')
>>> print(ship.positions)
{('F', 5): False, ('F', 6): False, ('F', 7): False, ('F', 8): False}
```

The value passed to the `name` parameter is valid when it is one of the keys stored in the `SHIP_SIZE` dictionary. Be sure to assign the value referenced by the `name` parameter to the `name` attribute of the `Ship` object being initialized.

The ship's `sunk` attribute is initialized to `False` in the `__init__()` method definition.

Once the `Ship` class' `__init__()` method has been implemented, try submitting your `battleship.py` file to Gradescope to see if your implementation passes the **Step A** tests. Once your program passes the **Step A** tests, proceed to **Step B**.

<a name="stepB"></a>
#### Step B - Enable Game initialization Method: `Game.__init__(self,
max_misses)` and `Game.initialize_board(self)`

```python
def __init__(self, max_misses = MAX_MISSES):
    """ Creates a new game with max_misses possible missed guesses.
    The board is initialized in this function and ships are randomly
    placed on the board.

    :param max_misses: maximum number of misses allowed before game ends
    """
```

```python
def initialize_board(self):
    """Sets the board to it's initial state with each position occupied by
    a period ('.') string.

    :return: None
    """
```

A `Game` object keeps track of the state of a single game. This includes the existing ships, the board, and position guesses that have been made by the player. The `Game`'s `__init__()` method has two main responsibilities: initializing the board and placing the ships on the board. You will implement two separate methods for performing these tasks and call the methods within the definition of the `Game`'s `__init__()` method. The `Game` `__init__()` method has 1 parameter (excluding `self`). The value of the `max_misses` parameter is the value used to set the `max_misses` attribute of the `Game` object being instantiated. Use the program constant `MAX_MISSES` as the default parameter value for `max_misses`. Initialize the `max_misses` attribute for the `Game` object to the value passed to the `max_misses` parameter in the `__init__()` method definition. Initialize the `Game` object's `ships` attribute to an empty `list` in the `__init__()` method definition. Finally, initialize the `Game` object's `guesses` attribute to an empty `list` in the `__init__()` method definition.

| **Attribute** | **Type** | **Description**                                                         |
| :------------ | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `board`       | `dict`   | dictionary of string/list key-value pairs representing the game's board |
| `max_misses`  | `int`    | maximum number of misses allowed in a game                              |
| `guesses`     | `list`   | positions guessed by player                                             |
| `ships`       | `list`   | list of Ship objects in game                                            |

_**Table 2**: The **`Game`** class's attributes._

**Step B** focuses on initializing the board. The `intialize_board()` has no parameters (besides `self`). After this method is executed, the `board` attribute of a `Game` object can displayed to the player. The `board` attribute is a Python `dict`. The keys are uppercase letters (`A`-`J`). The corresponding value for each key is a `list` of 10 strings. The initial value for each item in the `list` is the period (`'.'`) string. Therefore, the `board` dictionary is a dictionary containing 10 `str`\\`list` key-value pairs.

For clarification, the `board` should be initialized in such a way that accessing the `C` row of the board will return a 10 item `list` where each item in the `list` is the period string (`.`).

```out
>>> game.board['C']
['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']
```

The initial board (a `dict`) can be visualized with the row values (the `dict` keys) referencing a list of periods (the `dict` values).

A &rarr; | . | . | . | .| . | . | . | . | . | . |  
B &rarr; | . | . | . | .| . | . | . | . | . | . |  
C &rarr; | . | . | . | .| . | . | . | . | . | . |  
 ...  
I &rarr; | . | . | . | .| . | . | . | . | . | . |  
J &rarr; | . | . | . | .| . | . | . | . | . | . |

Implement the `Game` `__init__()` method such that it initializes the `board` attribute to an empty `dict`. Implement the `Game` `initialize_board()` method to populate the `board` `dict` as described above. After implementing the `Game` `initialize_board()` method, call the `initialize_board()` method on the `Game` instance within the `Game` `__init__()` method definition. Implementation of the `Game` `__init__()` method continues in **Step C** and **Step D**.

After defining the methods `__init__()` and `initialize_board()` in the `Game` class, try submitting your `battleship.py` file to Gradescope to see if your implementation passes the **Step B** tests. Once your program passes the **Step B** tests, proceed to **Step C**.

<a name="stepC"></a>
#### Step C - Identify in-bounds and non-overlapping ship positions

Methods: `Game.in_bounds(self, start_position, ship_size, orientation)` and `Game.overlaps_ship(self, start_position, ship_size, orientation)`

```python
def in_bounds(self, start_position, ship_size, orientation):
    """Checks that a ship requiring ship_size positions can be placed at start position.

    :param start_position: tuple representing the starting position of ship on the board
    :param ship_size: number of positions needed to place ship
    :param orientation: the orientation of the ship ('v' - vertical, 'h' - horizontal)
    :return status: True if ship placement inside board boundary, False otherwise
    """
```

```python
def overlaps_ship(self, start_position, ship_size, orientation):
    """Checks for overlap between previously placed ships and a potential new ship
    placement requiring ship_size positions beginning at start_position in the
    given orientation.

    :param start_position: tuple representing the starting position of ship on the board
    :param ship_size: number of positions needed to place ship
    :param orientation: the orientation of the ship ('v' - vertical, 'h' - horizontal)
    :return status: True if ship placement overlaps previously placed ship, False otherwise
    """
```

This step focuses on implementation of methods for determining valid ship placements. Recall these rules of the game.

1. Ships cannot be outside of the boundaries of the board.
1. A newly placed ship cannot overlap with a ship that has already been placed.

Therefore, in order to place ships, we want to define two methods which are helpful for identifying valid ship placements.

The `in_bounds()` method has 4 parameters (including `self`). `start_position` is the initial position on the `board` that the ship will occupy on successful placement. `ship_size` is the number of positions on the `board` required to place the ship. `orientation` is the horizontal (`h`) or vertical (`v`) orientation being considered for the ship. This method returns `True` when a ship occupying `ship_size` positions starting at `start_position` in the given `orientation` would not exceed the boundaries of the `board`. For example, consider a randomly generated position, `('D', 9)`, when trying to place a `destroyer` (requiring 2 positions) on the board below.

```out
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
A . . . . . . . . . .
B . . . . . . . . . .
C . . . . . . . . . .
D . . . . . . . . . s
E . . . . . . . . . .
F . . . . . . . . . .
G . . . . . . . . . .
H . . . . . . . . . .
I . . . . . . . . . .
J . . . . . . . . . .
```

The `s` on the board represents the `start_position`. Notice, that a horizontal (`h`) placement of the `destroyer` is not possible because the ship would fall outside of the bounds of the board. Therefore, a call to `in_bounds()` with these parameter values returns `False`.

```out
>>> pos = ('D',9)
>>> size = 2
>>> orient = 'h'
>>> game.in_bounds(pos, size, orient)
False
```

However, a call to `in_bounds()` when `orientation` is passed the value `v`, the return value of `in_bounds()` is `True`.

```out
>>> pos = ('D',9)
>>> size = 2
>>> orient = 'v'
>>> game.in_bounds(pos, size, orient)
True
```

When a ship placement in the `v` orientation is considered, `start_position` represents the smallest row value in lexicographic ordering of the rows that are occupied by the ship. When a ship placement in the `h` orientation is considered, `start_position` represents the smallest column value of the columns that are occupied by the ship.

As `ship`s are placed on the `board`, some placements will not be possible because such placements would cause `ship` positions to overlap. The `overlaps_ship()` method has the same 4 parameters that are defined for the `in_bounds()` method. Consider the board below:

```out
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
A . . . . . . . . . .
B . . . . . . . . . .
C . . . . . . . . . .
D . ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ . . . .
E . . . . . . . . . .
F . . . . . . . . . .
G . . . . . . . . . .
H . . . . . . . . . .
I . . . . . . . . . .
J . . . . . . . . . .
```

The `^`s represent a ship occupying positions `('D',1)`, `('D',2)`, `('D',3)`, `('D',4)`, and `('D',5)`. An attempt to place a `battleship` at position `('B',2)` in vertical (`v`) orientation is not allowed because it would cause two ships to occupy the same position. Therefore, the corresponding method invocation of `overlaps_ship()` would return `True`.

```out
>>> pos = ('B',2)
>>> size = 4
>>> orient = 'v'
>>> game.overlaps_ship(pos, size, orient)
True
```

However, for the board above, the `overlaps_ship()` method invocation for the same `ship_size` and `start_position` using the horizontal (`h`) orientation would return `False`.

```out
>>> pos = ('B',2)
>>> size = 4
>>> orient = 'h'
>>> game.overlaps_ship(pos, size, orient)
False
```

The `overlaps_ship()` method requires checking the keys of the `positions` dictionary for possible overlapping board positions of previously placed ships. Keep in mind that if a ship has been placed in the game, the ship will already have been added to the `ships` list for the `Game` object. You may be asking, when did we place ships on the `board`. The answer is that we have not yet implemented this part of the program. Ship placement will be implemented in `Step D` and `Step E`. However, for implementing the `overlaps_ship()` method, assume that the `Game` instances `ships` list may contains ships that have been already be placed in the game. You have defined all of the data attributes required to implement the `in_bounds()` and `overlaps_ship()` methods despite not yet having implemented the functionality for placing ships and adding the ships to the `ships` list of the `Game` object.

After defining the methods `in_bounds()` and `overlaps_ship()` methods in the `Game` class, try submitting your `battleship.py` file to Gradescope to see if your implementation passes the **Step C** tests. Once your program passes the **Step C** tests, proceed to **Step D**.

<a name="stepD"></a>
#### Step D - Identify valid ship placement positions

Method: `Game.place_ship(self, start_position, ship_size)`

```python
def place_ship(self, start_position, ship_size):
    """Determines if placement is possible for ship requiring ship_size positions placed at
    start_position. Returns the orientation where placement is possible or None if no placement
    in either orientation is possible.

    :param start_position: tuple representing the starting position of ship on the board
    :param ship_size: number of positions needed to place ship
    :return orientation: 'h' if horizontal placement possible, 'v' if vertical placement possible,
        None if no placement possible
    """
```

Let's now use `in_bounds()` and `overlaps_ship()` in order to determine if a ship of a given `ship_size` can be placed on the `board` at a given `start_position`. Again, the rules for placing ships:

1. Ships cannot be outside of the boundaries of the board.
1. A newly placed ship cannot overlap with a ship that has already been placed.

Both conditions need to be satisfied in order to allow a ship to be placed. The `place_ship()` method has 2 parameters (excluding `self`). `start_position` is the first position on the `board` where the `ship` will be placed for a potential placement. `ship_size` is the number of positions on the `board` required to place the ship. This method first checks that a ship placement at `start_position` for a ship requiring `ship_size` positions in the horizontal (`h`) orientation is in the bounds of the board and does not overlap any previously placed ship. In the case that a horizontal placement is possible, the method invocation returns `h`. In the case that the ship cannot be placed in the horizontal orientation, the method checks that a ship placement at `start_position` for a ship requiring `ship_size` positions in the vertical (`v`) orientation is in the bounds of the board and does not overlap any previously placed ship. In the case that a horizontal placement is possible, the method invocation returns `v`. In the case that the ship cannot be placed in the vertical orientation, the method returns `None`.

Consider the board below:

```out
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
A . . . . . . . . . .
B . . . . . . . . . .
C . . . . ^ ^ ^ ^ . .
D . . . . . . . . . .
E . . . . . . . . . .
F . . . . . . . . . .
G . . . . . . . . . .
H . . . . . . . . . .
I . . . . . . . . . .
J . . . . . . . . . .
```

A ship is currently occupying positions `('C', 4)`, `('C', 5)`, `('C', 6)`, and `('C', 7)`. Attempting to place a ship requiring 3 positions with a `start_position` of `('A', 6)` in the vertical (`v`) orientation does not exceed the boundaries of the board. However, this placement is not possible because the ship would overlap a previously placed ship at position `('C',' 6)`.

Using a horizontal (`h`) orientation, the placement is possible. This is the case because the placement is completely inside of the boundaries of the board **and** does not overlap the ship that was previously placed.

```out
>>> pos = ('A',6)
>>> size = 3
>>> game.place_ship(pos, size)
'h'
```

Therefore, the `place_ship()` method invocation returns `h`, indicating that this ship can be placed horizontally.

Consider a different configuration of the game:

```out
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
A . . . . . . . . . .
B . . . . ^ . . . . .
C . . . . ^ . . . . .
D . . . . ^ . . . . .
E . . . . ^ . . . . .
F . . . . . . . . . .
G . . . . . . . . . .
H . . . . . . . . . .
I . . . . . . . . . .
J . . . . . . . . . .
```

A ship is currently occupying positions `('B', 4)`, `('C', 4)`, `('D', 4)`, and `('E', 4)`. Attempting to place a ship requiring 3 positions with a `start_position` of `('C', 3)` in the horizontal (`h`) orientation does not exceed the boundaries of the board. However, this placement is not possible because the ship would overlap a previously placed ship at position `('C', 4)`.

Using a vertical (`v`) orientation, the placement is possible. This is the case because the placement is completely inside of the boundaries of the board **and** does not overlap the ship that was previously placed.

```out
>>> pos = ('C',2)
>>> size = 3
>>> game.place_ship(pos, size)
'v'
```

Therefore, the `place_ship()` method invocation returns `v`, indicating that this ship can be placed vertically.

Finally, consider the following case:

```out
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
A . . . . . . . . . .
B . . . . ^ . . . . .
C . . . . ^ . . . . .
D . . . . ^ . . . . .
E . . . . ^ . . . . .
F . . . . . . . . . .
G . . ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ . . .
H . . . . . . . . . .
I . . . . . . . . . .
J . . . . . . . . . .
```

A ship is currently occupying positions `('B', 4)`, `('C', 4)`, `('D', 4)`, and `('E', 4)`. Another ship is occupying `('G', 2)`, `('G', 3)`, `('G', 4)`, `('G', 5)` and `('G', 6)`. Attempting to place a ship requiring 3 positions with a `start_position` of `('E', 2)` in the horizontal (`h`) orientation does not exceed the boundaries of the board. The same is true of attempting to place a ship requiring 3 positions with a `start_position` of `('E', 2)` in the vertical (`v`) orientation. However, neither placement is possible. A vertically oriented placement would overlap another ship at `('G', 2)`. A horizontally oriented placement would overlap another ship at `('E', 4)`.

```out
>>> pos = ('E',2)
>>> size = 3
>>> ret_val = game.place_ship(pos, size)
>>> print(ret_val)
None
```

Therefore, a method invocation of `place_ship()` in this situation would return neither `h` or `v` but would instead return `None`.

Your implementation of `place_ship()` will utilize method invocations of `in_bounds()` and `overlaps_ship()` as these methods implement the logic required for determining whether or not a ship of a given size, a proposed starting position, and a given orientation can be properly placed.

Once the `place_ship()` method has been implemented for the `Game` class, try submitting your `battleship.py` file to Gradescope to see if your implementation passes the **Step D** tests. Once your program passes the **Step D** tests, proceed to **Step E**.

#### Step E - Add ships to the game

Method: `Game.create_and_place_ships(self)`
Method to update: `Game.__init__(self, max_misses)`

```python
def create_and_place_ships(self):
    """Instantiates ship objects with valid board placements.

    :return: None
    """
```

Having implemented methods to identify where a ship can be located, the focus of this step is creating the game's ships and placing the ships on the board. The method `create_and_place_ships()` implements this functionality. This method has no other parameters besides `self`. All of the information required to create and place ships is contained within the `Game` object itself.

The game of Battleship would not be very interesting if all of the ships are clustered together and placed in easily predictable locations. Randomly placing ships creates a game where identifying the location of ships is more difficult. The `get_random_position()` helper function has been implemented for you. This function randomly generates a position within the bounds of the board as a potential starting location for a ship that needs to be placed on the board. This method will return a `tuple` such as `('E', 2)` representing a position on the board. In this example, `E` is a `string` representing the row label and `2` is an `int` representing the column label for a position. The function declaration and docstring are as follows:

export default Layout;
